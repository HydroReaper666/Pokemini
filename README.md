# Pokemini
Pokemon Mini emulator for 3DS

This is a Pokemon Mini emulator for 3DS. I'ts in 3dsx and CIA format.

It's a port on 3DS of the excellent Pokemini v0.6 by JustBurn with platform files adapted from PSP and NDS versions. Everything you'll see on your 3DS if from JustBurn, I only ported SDL code to 3DS libs and made it run at fullspeed.

Warnings
=====
This is an alpha release, sometimes the program freezes and there are little things to fix in the CIA version.

Contents
=====
- PokeMini_3DS.c is the main platform file and PokeMini_3DS.h it's header. It's based on the platform files of the PSP and 3DS versions with some ugly tweak for frame timing
- PokeMini_3DS_sound.c is the file that handles sounds function and PokeMini_3DS.h it's header. It's platform specific as 3DS has no SDL libs yet.
- The other .c and .h files are mods or tweaks of official Pokemini v0.6, made to work with 3DS platform. Most of this mods could be integrated in the next Pokemini release if JustBurn wants (The mods are mostly related to the use of an alpha channel in 32bpp mode and for handling the rgb32 blit mode that is implemented but not selectable). 
- Everything else is 3DSX and CIA file formats related, you can learn about it on gbatemp.org, in the 3DS homebrew section.
